<center><span class="heading"><u>Kickback</u></span></center>
<h2><u>Advantages</u> :</h2>KickBack seems to be Useful bot based on his abilities. Shocking ShockWave won't get energy charges on his ranged attacks being physical. And He's got quite high crit rate and power leak are also worth considering. When paired with ENFORCERS ,MotorMaster and RamJet, there's just no way to get rid of it. +50% power rate for melee hit means your power bar will be ahead of Opponent ,even though bots generate more power when taking hits. To make it worse KickBack would be draining power with power leaks. Power Leaks may help him to be useful in Expert and Master missions where you may need to fight long battles and prevent opponent from activating Special Attacks. His quick movements and attacks also make him easy to control and a good combo maker.<br>
When Duped, KickBack will give a hard kick on tailpipes of the bots who are arrogant on their heavy attacks
<br><br>
<h2><u>Weaknesses</u> :</h2>KickBack got Evade as the only defensive ability which is also not very effective. His must-be-avoided crit hits are also dodge-able without much difficulties. Drift, SideSwipe, Prime Mv1, Barricade, Arcee, Wasp, Galvatron, BEEs ,to say everyone with quick moves can be useful.<br><br>
In Case, you can't avoid getting hit, either due to MODs or slow reflexes. Then, Primal is your guy, just avoid using as much heavy attacks you can, to stay armored most of time. Other second Option is Bludgeon, His armor activates on CRIT hits and caps roughly 50% of damage at Rank 3-4. To conclude a normal CRIT hit typically does 150% of normal basic hit. So, capped normal CRIT (150%) will do 75% damage (150%/2) of uncapped normal basic hit.ALthough he reduced more damge than Primal and has Class Advantage, he can't avoid getting Power Leaks.<br>Another contestant is UltraMagnus, being lacking physical basic attacks, KickBack might really hard time knocking him, especially when Magnus is duped<br>Hound can be good, only if you are good at controlling him. Though, personally, I'm little messed up controlling him.

There might have times when kept our 2*/3* like they are made up of diamonds. As we progressed, we got many of the 4*s and those "diamond bots" started to be looking as too weak and useless. So, What to do? FORGE 'em out.<br>
<h2>So, What will you get from Forging them</h2>:- Increased HP and Attack Rating and Monster boosts upon Class Advantages<br>:- Resources like Shards, Gold and Ore-13.
<h2>When it's Best to Forge the Bots</h2>:- When you've ranked and Leveled Up the bot as much you can. Duping increases resources and forge XP you get.<br>:-Don't forge 2* directly into 4* unless you don't any other 3*. Forge 2* into the 3*;then forge the 3* into 4*. 4* will get the same forge XP, but you may get even more resources while forging 3* in 4*.<h2>How much the Forge can affect your bots</h2>
Let's say you have a 4*, at FORGE 0, which currently has:<br>7000 HP and 700 ATK<br>7000 HP and 975 ATK  with Class Advantage 
<br><br>This SAME BOT (same Rank and Level), upgraded to FORGE 100, would become:<br>
9100 HP and 910 ATK<br>9100 HP and 1625 ATK with Class Advantage<br><br>
<h2>How much Forge XP your bot can provide:</h2>Excludes extra Forge XP that your bot got from Forging.<br><br>
<h3>2* Bot Forge Points Generates :</h3> Between 159-2161 Points<br>
Range => Rank 1-Level 1 to Rank 3-Level 30<br>Plus:- Sig Level x 31<br><br>
<h3>3* Bot Forge Points Generates  :</h3> Between  1,132 - 11,091 Points<br>
Range => Rank 1-Level 1 to Rank 4-Level 40<br>Plus:- Sig Level x 220

<center><h2>Maps are available <a href="./maps.html"><u class="linktext" >Here!</u></a></h2></center><br>
<h3>Basic Info</h3>There are 6 paths, 3 on each side (Left-Right); Player from each side won't meet players from other till Last Boss<br>
There are 3 rooms in each side till the BOSS, with each room ending with a mini-boss.<br>
Each Mini-Bot is buffed with links from two Sharkticons.<br>
One Shark can killed by only player on outer paths (1 / 6). Other can be killed by either of players on inner paths (2-3 / 4-5)<br><br>
<h3>Path Tips</h3>The Best Way to survive to the last is plan the right path with right bots. The player who are unsure about their activeness should take inner paths. Player need not to stick to a single path, they may inter-change path based on their bots and skills.<br><br>
<h3>Bot Tips</h3>Here's a brief list of bots of power buffs :-<ul><li>Buffed/Unblockable Ranged : Quick Bots like Galvatron | Barricade | BEEs | Mirage</li><li>PyroPhobia : Just Avoid Getting Hit</li><li>HemoPhobia : Power Buff is verryy weak</li><li>ElectroPhobia : SoundWave|ShockWave</li><li>Armor : MAGNUS! | Dinbot | Prime</li><li>Power Rate Debuffs (Path 6) : Heavy Special | Power gain Ability</li></ul></div>
<div id="bot-tips" class="subcontent"><!----Use Drop Down. So, that viwers can browse through different bots easily--->
<button id="bee-kid" class="drop-content" onclick="dropdown('bee-kid-info', 'bee-kid')">BEE on the Skates</button>
<div id="bee-kid-info" style="display:none;">
Well, this kid on the skates gives a tight fight, he got a pretty powerful melee evade that will never elapse until he evades an attack, and he regains it when he dahes back, and dash back is very common move that A.I. as well as WE all do. When enhanced with MOD, even Drift might not be able to tackle his evades.<br>HotRod is the man to teach the kid who's the BOSS, his de-acceleration ranged attack nullifies all the evades and decreases power rate which almost tackles his sign ability and makes BEE NOT SO BRAVE.<br>For duped Bludgeon paired with SwordMasters, Let him evade and activate CRIT damage buff. Now , it time for the combo: Two Ranged > Heavy and repeat until He throws a "DEATH CRIT". Try not to throw 3 ranged attacks in row, this way your bot kinda get locked for fraction of a second, this is very enough for A.I. to initiate combo<br>All-Ranged relying bots can prove to be useful. Ultra-Magnus is also a good option: Ranged Heavy, Ranged Specials.<br>
Primal is also so quick moving if he misses an attack, it should easy dash back and engage in combo immediately, plus he is totally resistant to his CRIT buffs.<br>In Scouts, Barricade is useful. Demolitions ARE ranged relying.
</div>
<button id="primal" class="drop-content" onclick="dropdown('primal-info', 'primal')">Primal Ape</button>
<div id="primal-info" style="display:none">
Primal is nightmare for those who are proud of their CRIT hits. You have to wait for this Gorilla to launch a heavy attack so that we have some time to initiate special attacks to let them have crit chance.<br>While Official Stats say Megatron is best match-up for Primal because of permanent Armor Break as Primal don't generate any more armors with Armor Break. But, if Primal still has several more armors, you'll still lack ability to hit CRIT.<br>
When Using Magnus, you'll definitely want primal to generate as much armors as he can. Magnus' basic do do much much damage anyway, the ability to generate number of armors will surely wreck havoc on him when Magnus will covert each armor buff in in a armor break and increase special damage upto +150%. And Basic and Heavy attacks ,especially CRIT, will make the Gorilla Bot forget the laws of jungle.
